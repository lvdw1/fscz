      We are writing this letter to express our sincere interest and desire to participate in FSA 2024. We are a relatively new team from Belgium trying to make our entrance in the world of Formula Student.
      Letâ€™s take a step back and travel to the summer of 2022.
      Once upon a time a group of enthusiastic and ambitious students from the UGent Racing team travelled to the Spielberg Circuit in Austria. Their hearts raced with excitement, and their eyes gleamed with determination as they prepared to participate in their first-ever Formula Student competition season.
      As the UGent Racing team entered the paddock, their eyes widened at the sight of sleek, professionally designed race cars and experienced teams that surrounded them. Undeterred by the intimidating atmosphere, the young team embraced the fellowship of the event and marvelled at the engineering brilliance on display.
